        </div>
        <div class="content">


            <p class="p1">Poverty reduction occurs largely as a result of overall economic growth. Food shortages
                were common before modern agricultural technology and in places that lack them today, such as nitrogen
                fertilizers, pesticides and irrigation methods. The dawn of the Industrial Revolution led to high
                economic growth, eliminating mass poverty in what is now considered the developed world. World GDP
                per person quintupled during the 20th century. In 1820, 75% of humanity lived on less than a dollar a
                day, while in 2001 only about 20% did.

                Today, continued economic development is constrained by the lack of economic freedoms. Economic
                liberalization requires extending property rights to the poor, especially to land. Financial
                services, notably savings, can be made accessible to the poor through technology, such as mobile
                banking.Inefficient institutions, corruption, and political instability can also discourage
                investment. Aid and government support in health, education, and infrastructure helps growth by
                increasing human and physical capital.

                <p class="p1">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge,
                    skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development. Education originated as
                    transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals
                    increasingly encompass new ideas such as liberation of learners, critical thinking about presented
                    information, skills needed for the modern society, empathy and complex vocational skills.
                    <br><br>UNESCO defines three main learning settings. Formal education takes place in education and
                    training institutions, is usually structured by curricular aims and objectives, and learning is
                    typically guided by a teacher. In most regions, formal education is compulsory up to a certain age
                    and commonly divided into educational stages such as kindergarten, primary school and secondary
                    school. Nonformal learning occurs as addition or alternative to formal education. It may be
                    structured according to educational arrangements, but in a more flexible manner, and usually takes
                    place in community-based, workplace-based or civil society-based settings. Lastly, informal settings
                    occurs in daily life, in the family, any experience that has a formative effect on the way one
                    thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational, whether unintentional or intentional. In
                    practice there is a continuum from the highly formalized to the highly informalized, and informal
                    learning can occur in all three settings. For instance, homeschooling can be classified as
                    nonformal or informal, depending upon the structure

                    <p class="p1">Technology is the continually developing result of accumulated knowledge and
                        application in all techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in industrial production and
                        scientific research. Technology is embedded in the operation of all machines, with or without
                        detailed knowledge of their function, for the intended purpose of an organization. The
                        technologies of society consist of what is known as systems. Systems apply the intended
                        application of a technology's accumulated knowledge by obtaining an input, altering this input
                        for the system's intended purpose through what is known as a process, and then producing an
                        outcome that alters the ultimate intended purpose of the system. This is also known as a
                        technology system or technological system.
                        <br><br>The earliest and simplest form of technology is the development of knowledge that leads to
                        the application of basic tools towards an intended purpose. The prehistoric invention of shaped
                        stone tools and the discovery of how to control fire and increased the sources of food that were
                        available to human beings through the proper cooking procedures that eliminated almost all
                        disease-causing pathogens in food sources. The event that occurred after, the Neolithic
                        Revolution, extended the importance of this event and quadrupled the sustenance available from a
                        usable territory through the development of farming technologies.
